Sports Medicine, 50(10), 1813–1827.",10.1007/s40279-020-01319-3,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Multiple studies (meta-analysis),2020.0,"This systematic review and meta-analysis found that exercise performance is trivially reduced during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle compared to all other phases. The effect size was very small, and the confidence in the evidence was low due to high variability between studies. The overall conclusion suggests that, on average, performance differences across the menstrual cycle are negligible for most women, but a personalized approach is recommended for elite athletes based on individual responses.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Performance

Performance was consistent across the OCP cycle phases, suggesting that the exogenous hormones do not significantly enhance or impair performance. The authors suggest that individual responses to OCPs are highly variable and more influential than any group-level effect.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Performance

The largest, though still small, negative effect was observed between the early follicular and late follicular phases. Due to the trivial effect size and large variation across studies, the authors recommend a personalized approach rather than general guidelines for training across the menstrual cycle.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Performance

The early follicular phase (EFP), when sex hormone concentrations (including estrogen) are lowest, showed the greatest DOMS and strength loss, suggesting women may be more vulnerable to muscle damage and require longer recovery periods during this phase. Conversely, the midluteal phase (MLP), characterized by higher estrogen and progesterone, showed the least EIMD, indicating a potential protective effect of these hormones on muscle recovery.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Recovery

While the study primarily focused on performance, the background section highlights that oestrogen is thought to play a role in substrate metabolism changes through increased muscle glycogen storage and increased fat utilisation, which is the underlying mechanism for the observed performance differences. The overall effect size was trivial, and the authors recommend a personalized approach due to large between-study variation and low quality of evidence in the primary studies.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Performance/Metabolism

This suggests a shift toward sympathetic dominance and potentially increased cardiovascular strain during the luteal phase, which is relevant for heart rate-based training prescription. The findings highlight the need for personalized training approaches that account for these cyclical changes in autonomic regulation.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Cardiovascular/Autonomic Response

The early follicular phase was found to be unfavorable for all strength classes, while isokinetic strength peaked during ovulation. These findings suggest that strength training periodization based on the menstrual cycle, specifically targeting the late follicular phase, may optimize strength gains.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Performance

Frontiers in Physiology, 12, 654585.",10.3389/fphys.2021.654585,Systematic Review,Multiple studies (systematic review),2021.0,"The systematic review found that studies on non-elite athletes have reported the intensity corresponding to the lactate threshold (LT) was higher during the luteal phase (LP) than the follicular phase (FP), suggesting lower blood lactate concentrations during exercise in the LP. However, the review concluded that for elite athletes, performance outcomes, including those related to endurance, appear to remain stable along the menstrual cycle, and the overall evidence is inconclusive regarding the optimal phase for performance.

Specifically, glutamate/malate LEAK respiration was higher in the luteal phase, while fatty acid-supported coupling efficiency and mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emission were significantly higher in the early follicular phase. These findings suggest a limited, but measurable, phase-dependent effect on submaximal mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species generation, which may influence training adaptations.",Tier B (Single high-quality RCT/cohort),Mitochondrial Function

However, a higher maximal RER was observed in the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase during incremental exercise, indicating a shift towards greater fat oxidation in the luteal phase. This suggests that while overall differences are small, the high-hormone luteal phase may promote fat as a fuel source, which is beneficial for endurance events like marathon running.",Tier A (Meta-analysis/multiple RCTs),Substrate Utilization

However, the literature suggests that transdermal estradiol may increase lumbar BMD, and it is recommended as a second-line comanagement strategy to optimize bone health in amenorrhoeic athletes, while oral contraceptives should not be used for this purpose.
